mkdir response
cd response
```

### 4. Copy the HTML File to the Web Root Directory

## Key Notes

- Ensure that the EC2 instance has the necessary security group rules to allow HTTP traffic (port 80).
- Test the setup by accessing the EC2 instance's public IP address in a web browser.
- The `response.html` file should contain the content of the webpage you wish to host.

By following these commands, you can successfully host a website on an EC2 instance using Apache.
