## Commands for AWS S3 and EC2 Integration

### 1. Install AWS CLI

```bash
snap install aws-cli --classic
```

### 2. Configure AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure
```

- Enter all default values by pressing `Enter` at each prompt.

### 3. List All Buckets

```bash
aws s3 ls
```

### 4. List Contents of a Specific Bucket

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name
```

Replace `bucket-name` with the name of your S3 bucket.

### 5. Upload a File to S3

```bash
aws s3 cp file-in-ec2-machine s3://bucket-name
```

Replace `file-in-ec2-machine` with the path to the file on your EC2 instance, and `bucket-name` with the name of your S3 bucket.

### 6. Download a File from S3

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://bucket-name/file-in-bucket /directory-in-ec2-machine
```

Replace `file-in-bucket` with the name of the file in the S3 bucket and `/directory-in-ec2-machine` with the destination directory on your EC2 instance.

## Key Notes

- Ensure that the EC2 instance has an IAM role with appropriate permissions to access S3.
- Follow these commands in the specified order to achieve seamless integration.
